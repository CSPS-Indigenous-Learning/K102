        <h2>Métis National Council</h2>
        <p>In 1983, the <a href="#" data-ext="wb-ext-18" class="external">Métis National Council</a> was created to achieve a clear definition and defence of Métis rights and to act as a united voice on behalf of Métis. The Council was formed by representatives from elected, province-based governance structures.</p>
        <p>The Government of Canada and the Métis National Council and its Governing Members signed the <em>Canada-Métis Nation Accord</em> in April 2017.</p>
        <p>The Accord:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>marks a significant step towards a renewed nation-to-nation, government-to-government relationship based on recognition of rights, respect, co-operation and partnership</li>
            <li>outlines the ways in which the Government of Canada and the Métis Nation will work together to set priorities and co-develop distinctions-based policy in areas of shared interest</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The Métis National Council’s stated goal is &ldquo;to secure a healthy space for the Métis Nation’s ongoing existence within the Canadian federation.&rdquo; They have five current affiliates:</p>

            <li>Métis Nation of Ontario</li>
            <li>Manitoba Métis Federation</li>
            <li>Métis Nation Saskatchewan</li>
            <li>Métis Nation of Alberta</li>
            <li>Métis Nation British Columbia</li>
        </ul>
		<p>The Métis National Council also created the <strong>Women of the Métis Nation Association</strong>, which provides a platform for Métis women to promote and preserve their social, political and economic interests.</p>
        <!--<p>The Council has published their criteria for determining whether a person is Métis; however, membership is managed on a provincial level.</p>
