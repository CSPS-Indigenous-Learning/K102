		<p>The close relationship between First Nations and Métis communities remains strong today. Métis have been included in modern treaty negotiations in the Northwest Territories since the start of the territory-wide joint Dene-Métis negotiations in the late 1970s.&nbsp;This inclusion was intended to reflect the shared ancestry and close family connections.</p>
		<p>Agreements have been finalized with the Sahtu Dene and Métis, the Gwich’in and the Tlicho. Negotiations are currently underway with the <strong>Northwest Territory Métis Nation </strong>and Métis who are represented in the <a href="#" data-ext="wb-ext-20" class="external">Dehcho Process</a>.</p>
		<p>The <em>Métis Population Betterment Act </em>of 1938 was established to set aside land for <strong>Métis settlements</strong> in Alberta. In 1990, it was replaced by the <em>Métis Settlements Act</em>, which provided the <strong>legal transfer of land title to Métis people</strong>. As a result, <strong>eight settlement corporations</strong> and the <a href="#" data-ext="wb-ext-21" class="external">Métis Settlements General Council</a> were established as legal entities. The Government of Alberta’s approach is the <strong>only instance to date where Métis communities have their own dedicated land base</strong>. The Métis Settlements General Council is independent from the Métis National Council and its affiliates.</p>
		<p>In December 2015, the Government of Canada began negotiating with Métis groups in response to the <em>Manitoba Métis Federation Decision</em>. The Government of Canada is currently engaged in the recognition and implementation of Indigenous rights. This will eventually lead to formal negotiations to address the outstanding rights, interests and claims of Métis.</p>

			<p>As a public service employee, you must understand that Métis:</p>

				<li>have not always been &ldquo;accepted&rdquo; as Indigenous and have had to fight for the rights they are entitled to</li>
				<li>are quickly moving forward in establishing their own governments</li>
				<li>are negotiating with the federal and provincial governments to develop treaties and self-government agreements that will better position the Métis in Canada moving forward</li>
