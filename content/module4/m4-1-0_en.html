        <h2>Historic treaties</h2>
        <p>The first treaty relationship with Métis can be found in the <em>Manitoba Act, 1870.</em> The Supreme Court of Canada has declared the <strong><em>Manitoba Act</em> as having treaty-like characteristics</strong> with respect to Métis. Certain features, undertakings and outcomes of the <a href="#glossaryMSC" class="csps-glossary" data-effect="mfp-zoom-in">Métis Scrip Commission</a> have similar characteristics as well.</p>
        <p>The next inclusion occurred during the signing of some of the <strong>Numbered Treaties</strong>. These were a series of <strong>11 </strong><a href="#" data-ext="wb-ext-19" class="external">treaties</a> made between the Government of Canada and Indigenous peoples from 1871 to 1921. The territories relating to these treaties are shown in the image.</p>
        <h2><strong>Treaty 3 </strong></h2>
        <p>This treaty was signed in 1873 between the Government of Canada and the Ojibway First Nations. In 1875, the Métis were granted an adhesion to Treaty 3. <strong>While this was later removed from the treaty, it demonstrates that the Government of Canada recognized the rights of Métis</strong>.</p>
		<h2 style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>Treaties 8 and 11</strong></h2>
        <p>Treaties 8 and 11 were intended to address the rights and title of Indigenous peoples. Some Métis families had to choose between taking part in the treaty (as per the other First Nations) or receiving a scrip (as per the Métis Nations).</p>
