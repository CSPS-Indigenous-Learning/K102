1
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:07,320
I forgive them with all my heart as I ask God to forgive me.

2
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:11,040
[off camera]: The verdict is clear. You're guilty of high treason.

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,640
But let them remember that I struggled for the Métis,

4
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,160
for the people of Manitoba and the North-West.

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,900
[off camera]: There can be no excuse for what you have done...

6
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:18,740
The Métis are not birds.

7
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:20,640
[off camera]: the law requires you to answer for it.

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,440
We have a right to God's lands.

9
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,300
Insane? I have battled an insane and irresponsible government.

10
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,160
[off camera]: You will be taken to the place appointed for your execution.

11
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,780
Perhaps I am a prophet -- I suffered enough.

12
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,380
[off camera]: hanged by the neck until you are dead.

13
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,880
I struggled not only for myself,

14
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:43,240
but for the rights of my people, the Métis.

15
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,860
Métis woman: Louis Riel led our Métis nation,

16
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,240
and he gave us hope and strength and pride.

17
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,540
Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
