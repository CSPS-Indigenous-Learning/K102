         <p begin="00:00:15.93" end="00:00:18.86">IT MAY SEEM EASY TO IDENTIFY WHO YOU ARE,</p>
         <p begin="00:00:19.06" end="00:00:21.46">BUT WHEN YOU&apos;RE BORN WITH FAIR SKIN,</p>
         <p begin="00:00:21.46" end="00:00:24.63">IT CAN GET A LITTLE CONFUSING.</p>

         <p begin="00:00:31.63" end="00:00:34.26">I GREW UP IN THIS PRETTY LITTLE PLACE CALLED</p>

         <p begin="00:00:38.90" end="00:00:41.93">BEING BROUGHT TO MY RACE WAS WHEN I WAS ABOUT 7.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:41.93" end="00:00:47.33">(♪ bell ringing ♪)</p>
         <p begin="00:00:48.96" end="00:00:53.80">THERE WAS THIS TEACHER, WHO SAID SOMETHING TO ME THAT PRETTY MUCH</p>
         <p begin="00:00:53.80" end="00:00:55.96">SCARRED ME FOR YEARS TO COME.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:56.16" end="00:00:59.66">SHE SAID - &quot;INDIANS ARE LIKE APPLES.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:59.66" end="00:00:63.56">THEY MAY BE RED ON THE OUTSIDE, BUT ON THE INSIDE THEY ARE</p>
         <p begin="00:00:63.56" end="00:00:69.70">WHITE, JUST LIKE THE REST OF US AND THAT MAKES THEM OKAY.&quot;</p>
         <p begin="00:00:69.70" end="00:00:71.83">AND THERE IT WAS.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:71.83" end="00:00:75.06">ONLY THEN IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THERE WERE DIFFERENCES WITH</p>
         <p begin="00:00:75.06" end="00:00:77.93">PEOPLE, AND THEN I THOUGHT MORE OF EATING THAT APPLE THAN WHAT</p>
         <p begin="00:00:77.93" end="00:00:80.30">SHE MEANT BY IT AT THE TIME.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:80.30" end="00:00:83.46">SO, I RAN OUT WITH MY NEW KNOWLEDGE AND HAPPILY TOLD</p>
         <p begin="00:00:83.66" end="00:00:86.86">AT LEAST 10 OTHER LITTLE INDIANS THAT WE WERE ALL APPLES,</p>
         <p begin="00:00:87.06" end="00:00:89.60">AND THAT MADE US ALL OKAY.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:89.80" end="00:00:91.76">THIS MAY HAVE BEEN TRUE ON THE RESERVE,</p>
         <p begin="00:00:91.76" end="00:00:94.16">BUT WHEN I LEFT MY COMMUNITY AND WENT TO A SCHOOL</p>

         <p begin="00:00:98.90" end="00:00:101.83">AUGH! AND FOUND THAT WE WEREN&apos;T SO WHITE INSIDE.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:102.86" end="00:00:106.36">I SOON NOTICED THAT I WAS WHITER ON THE OUTSIDE THAN THE OTHER</p>

         <p begin="00:00:115.00" end="00:00:118.60">I EARNESTLY TRIED TO BE OKAY LIKE THE REST OF THEM.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:118.60" end="00:00:121.70">HAVING A PALE FACE MAY HAVE OPENED THE DOORS,</p>
         <p begin="00:00:121.70" end="00:00:123.80">BUT THAT ACCEPTANCE WAS SHORT-LIVED,</p>
         <p begin="00:00:123.80" end="00:00:128.16">EVEN I LEARNED HOW TO REJECT MY UNIDENTIFIABLE SELF.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:131.20" end="00:00:134.63">THAT EARLY, BUT FLAWED LABEL, TRIGGERED A HUNGER IN ME</p>
         <p begin="00:00:134.63" end="00:00:137.36">TO FIND AN IDENTITY THAT WORKED.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:137.36" end="00:00:140.20">AS IT TURNED OUT, THERE ARE PLENTY OF PEOPLE,</p>
         <p begin="00:00:140.20" end="00:00:145.66">BOOKS AND GOVERNMENTS TO TELL ME JUST WHO I...WAS?</p>
         <p begin="00:00:148.00" end="00:00:151.16">FINDING OUT I HAD SWEDISH HERITAGE (yodeling)</p>
         <p begin="00:00:151.36" end="00:00:153.90">ONLY ADDED TO THE CONFUSION.</p>
