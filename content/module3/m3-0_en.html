		<h2>The creation of Métis people</h2>
		<p>The birth of the <a href="#" data-ext="wb-ext-7" class="external">Métis Nation</a> dates back to the fur trade in central and western regions of North America. European voyageurs, hired to transport the fur by canoe, used to travel from First Nations communities such as Michilimackinac and Sault Ste. Marie by water ways and watersheds to the Red River, then through the prairies and on to the United States.</p>
		<p>Communities sprang up along the fur trade route. Many voyageurs eventually settled there as <a href="#glossaryGensLibres" class="csps-glossary" data-effect="mfp-zoom-in"><span lang="fr"><em>gens libres</em></span></a>. They formed close family relationships with First Nations people, and a distinct population began to emerge with a common language, way of life, traditions and history.</p>
		<h2>Rupert’s Land</h2>
		<p>The Métis Nation’s homeland is situated in what was then called <strong>Rupert’s Land</strong>. <u><a href="#" data-ext="wb-ext-8" class="external">Rupert's Land</a></u> was a vast continental expanse comprising of a third of what is now Canada.</p>
		<p>In 1670, King Charles II of England granted control over this territory to the <strong>Hudson's Bay Company</strong>. In today’s world, the ability of an English king to unilaterally claim control over a territory seems unreasonable. Many grievances of the Métis people can be traced back to this decision.</p>

		<p>Three years after Confederation, the Government of Canada purchased this vast territory from the <strong>Hudson’s Bay Company</strong> for $1.5 million. The Government acquired the land <strong>without consulting</strong> the Indigenous people living in the territory.</p>
