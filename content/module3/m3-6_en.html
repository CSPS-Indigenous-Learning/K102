		<p>Residential schools also influenced the futures of <a href="#" data-ext="wb-ext-14" class="external">Métis children</a>. The education of Métis children has been a subject of contention since the Métis Nation began.</p>
		<p>Originally, Métis children were taught by their parents through experience, or in some instances, sent east or overseas for formal education. In the early 19th century, religious groups, mainly Catholic at the time, took over this responsibility. Métis parents had little input into the schooling provided by these groups, which was <strong>dictated</strong> by the practices and perceptions of the <strong>religious leaders</strong>.</p>
		<p>After Confederation, the Government of Canada did not assume the responsibility of educating Métis children. Nor did any other level of government. <strong>This left many Métis children with no educational options.</strong></p>
		<p>In certain cases, some Métis children attended local schools. For example, a family who participated in the local religious community might have been allowed to send their children to the church-run school.</p>
		<p>When residential schools were established, Métis children were <strong>sometimes permitted to attend them</strong>. They were often taken in to <strong>increase the numbers</strong>, as the schools were funded on a per capita basis. Since the Métis families typically lived near the schools, the children would attend during the day and return home in the evening. These schools were referred to as <strong>residential day schools</strong>.</p>
		<p>Residential schools had a negative impact on the Métis children who attended them. While they were not forced to attend these schools, their experience was substantially the same as the children who were. Métis children were not allowed to speak their own language, such as Michif or Bungee, and they faced abuses of many kinds. This included the severe emotional abuse of being taught that their culture was inadequate and that they should abandon it for the colonial way of life.</p>
