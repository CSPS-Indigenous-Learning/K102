		<p><a href="#" data-ext="wb-ext-11" class="external">Louis Riel</a> emerged as a Métis leader. The Métis people of the Red River and many people in Quebec considered him a hero. When conflict arose between the Government of Canada and Louis Riel, he fled to the United States to avoid being killed. As a fugitive, he was elected <strong>three</strong> times to the House of Commons of Canada, although he was never able to take his seat in the house.</p>
		<p>Métis people were initially the predominant force in the new province of Manitoba. However, delays in implementing the provisions of the <em>Manitoba Act, 1870</em> and an increase in European settlers soon led to the Métis being marginalized. A second conflict broke out in 1885, which resulted in the defeat of Métis forces by federal troops and the execution of Louis Riel.</p>

                            <p><strong>Answer: All of the above</strong></p>
                            <p>Louis Riel is a central figure in Indigenous Canadian history. He was a leader among the Métis people of the Red River. In 1869–1870, he headed a provisional government that eventually negotiated the <strong>Manitoba Act</strong> within the Government of Canada. The Act established Manitoba as a province and provided some protection for French-language rights.</p>
							<p>Louis Riel was elected three times to the House of Commons, but was never able to take his seat in the house. After creating a provisional government in 1885 to defend Métis and Indigenous rights in Saskatchewan and Alberta, Riel was accused of treason. He was hanged on November 16, 1885, an event that has had lasting political implications.</p>
