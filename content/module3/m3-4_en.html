		<p>When Métis people received <strong>land allowances</strong> (or financial equivalents) from the Government of Canada, they were usually granted in the form of a paper scrip known as the <a href="#" data-ext="wb-ext-13" class="external">Métis scrip</a>. Unscrupulous speculators often pressured the Métis to sell their scrips cheaply on the spot.</p>
		<p>The Métis scrip policy specifically aimed to <strong>extinguish Métis title</strong>, much as the historic treaties did for First Nations. However, Métis were dealt with on an individual basis, as opposed to the collective extinguishment of title pursued through the treaty process.</p>
		<p>Members of the Métis Nation often ended up moving from their original settlements, spreading further west and north. As a result, the Métis Nation members can now be found in a <strong>wide range of regions </strong>in Western Canada. However, only a small number of Métis were able to claim the land they were entitled to.</p>
