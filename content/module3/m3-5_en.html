		<p>Once the Métis members lost access to the lands where they had lived, many became a displaced population with few options of where they could live. Many resorted to <strong>squatting</strong> on the land that was set aside by the Government of Canada for the building of future railways and roads. These Métis people came to be known as the &ldquo;<strong>Road Allowance People</strong>.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Since the families that settled on these lands did not own the land and didn’t pay taxes, they were constantly at risk of being displaced. Poor housing and lack of stability were constant worries for Métis people. In addition, their children could not attend schools.</p>
