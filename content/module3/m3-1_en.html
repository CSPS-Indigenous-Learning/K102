		<p><a href="#glossaryPemmican" class="csps-glossary" data-effect="mfp-zoom-in">Pemmican</a> was a main source of food supply for buffalo hunters and voyageurs. It preserved well and was light to carry. Pemmican was also an important aspect of the Métis economy.</p>
		<p>In 1814, the governor of the Red River Colony passed the <a href="#" data-ext="wb-ext-9" class="external">Pemmican Proclamation</a>, which stopped the export of pemmican and other food supplies from the colony. This proclamation destabilized the Métis’ trading cycle with the voyageurs of the North West Company and was met with resistance. The conflict came to a head in 1816 at the <a href="#" data-ext="wb-ext-10" class="external">Battle of Seven Oaks</a>.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>For the Métis people, this battle was a step towards becoming a nation. They came together and acted collectively to protect their interests in disputes with the Hudson’s Bay Company and the settlers arriving in their territory.</p>
