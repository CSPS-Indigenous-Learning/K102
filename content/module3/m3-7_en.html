		<h2><em>Constitution Act, 1982</em></h2>
		<details>
			<summary>Over the years, when the Government of Canada developed policies and programs for First Nations and Inuit, it did not take Métis people into consideration.</summary>
			<div class="row" style="margin-top: 15px;">
				<div class="col-md-7">
					<p>Only a few government policies focused specifically on the Métis.</p>
					<p>Métis people often found themselves in a position where they were forced to:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>deny their identity and pretend to be European settlers OR</li>
						<li>stay true to their identity and face hostility and discrimination from society</li>
					</ul>
					<p>In 1982, the Government of Canada patriated its Constitution from Britain and brought it to Canada. This changed the course of history for the Métis. The <em>Constitution Act, 1982</em> included a number of amendments to the Constitution of Canada, notably the addition of <a href="#glossarySection35" class="csps-glossary" data-effect="mfp-zoom-in">section 35</a>. Section 35 recognizes and affirms existing Aboriginal rights, such as treaty rights, for First Nations, <strong>Métis</strong> and Inuit.</p>

		<h2>Manitoba Métis Federation</h2>
		<details>
			<summary>In 1981, the Manitoba Métis Federation wanted to prove that by implementing the <em>Manitoba Act, 1870</em>, the Government of Canada breached <strong>fiduciary obligations owed to Métis</strong> and that certain legislation passed by the province of Manitoba affected the implementation of the <em>Manitoba Act</em>.</summary>
			<div class="row" style="margin-top: 15px;">
				<div class="col-md-7">
					<p>The Supreme Court of Canada held that <a href='#' data-ext="wb-ext-15" class="external">the Government of Canada <strong>failed to implement the land grant provisions</strong></a> set out in <a href="#glossarySection31" class="csps-glossary" data-effect="mfp-zoom-in">section 31</a> of the <em>Manitoba Act, 1870</em>, in a manner consistent with the honour of the Crown.&nbsp;</p>
					<p>This decision permitted the Manitoba Métis Federation to bring forth the claim on behalf of the descendants of Métis that were affected by the failure of the Crown as &ldquo;the body representing the collective Métis interest.&rdquo; It created a precedent for the Manitoba Métis Federation and other Métis National Council Affiliates as rights-bearing Métis collectives.</p>
					<p>The case was initially launched in 1981. A final decision was rendered in 2013—<strong>a total of 32 years in court!</strong></p>

		<h2>Daniels, Supreme Court of Canada, 2016</h2>
		<details>
			<summary>In <em>Daniels v Canada</em>, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that <strong>Métis and Non-Status Indians are &ldquo;Indians&rdquo; for purposes of the Constitution</strong>.</summary>
			<div class="row" style="margin-top: 15px;">
				<div class="col-md-7">
					<p>This determined that, under section 91(24) of the <em>Constitution Act, 1867</em>, the Government of Canada had legislative authority with respect to Métis people.</p>
					<p>While the 2016 <strong><a href="#" data-ext="wb-ext-16" class="external">decision</a> has not yet been fully implemented</strong>, its immediate impact is that Métis are now officially recognized as Indians. This does not mean that Métis fall under the <em>Indian Act</em> or other programs that are specific to First Nations or Inuit.</p>
					<p>The situation of Métis under the Canadian Constitution has changed many times since Canada came into being. The Métis are currently working hard with the Government of Canada to <strong>find their appropriate position in the legislation. </strong></p>
