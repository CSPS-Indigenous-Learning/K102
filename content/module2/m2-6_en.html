<div class="col-md-12">
	<p>Generally speaking, Métis are <strong>community-centred</strong> people with a rich and varied culture and many traditions. Historically and today, many Métis people celebrate individual and communal achievements during the &ldquo;<strong><a href="#glossaryRendezvous" class="csps-glossary" data-effect="mfp-zoom-in">rendezvous</a></strong>&rdquo;. The rendezvous is a celebratory event that includes community suppers, dances such as the <strong>Red River Jig</strong> and distinctive <strong>Métis fiddling</strong>.</p>
	<p>Here are a few iconic Métis cultural symbols&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;though not all Métis will identify with them. There are many more to discover!</p>

					<h2>The Métis flag is one of the oldest patriotic flags in Canada.</h2>
					<p>It was first used in 1816 by Métis resistance fighters before the Battle of Seven Oaks.</p>
					<p>The Métis Nation has had a number of flags over the years, but the blue background with the white infinity symbol is its most recognized emblem of nationhood.</p>
					<p>The white symbol has two meanings for the Métis: the joining of two cultures and the existence of a people forever.</p>
					<p>This blue and white flag is still flown today by the Métis Nation.</p>
