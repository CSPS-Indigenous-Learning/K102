		<h1>Who are Métis under the Canadian Constitution?</h1>
		<p>Since the <a class="csps-glossary" href="#glossaryRCAP" data-effect="mfp-zoom-in">Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples (RCAP)</a> released its report in 1996, there have been developments in legally defining Métis under section 35 of the <em>Constitution Act, 1982</em>.</p>
		<h2><em>R&nbsp;v&nbsp;Powley</em></h2>
		<p>From a political perspective, the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in <em><a href="#" data-ext="wb-ext-0" class="external">R&nbsp;v&nbsp;Powley</a></em> is an important starting point to understand who Métis are. Although the case was specifically about hunting rights, many people recognize the Powley decision as a way to determine other rights and protections for Métis under the Canadian Constitution.</p>
		<p>The 2003 decision provided a three-part test to identify <strong>Métis rights holders</strong>:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>self-identification as Métis</li>
			<li>ancestral connection to an historic Métis community</li>
			<li>community acceptance</li>
		</ul>

		<p>While this may provide a way of determining what rights and protections may be found under the Canadian Constitution, it does not provide a definition of who else may consider themselves Métis.</p>
		<h2>Métis Nation</h2>
		<p>The largest acknowledged Métis group under section 35(2) of the <em>Constitution Act, 1982</em> is the <strong>Métis Nation</strong>, which dates back to the time of the fur trade. These Métis people generally reside in parts of Ontario and westward and share a common heritage, history, culture, language and political identity.</p>
		<p>However, Métis communities exist elsewhere in Ontario and eastward. Many of them have made claims to the Government of Canada to also be recognized as official Métis groups in Canada.</p>
