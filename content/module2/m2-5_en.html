		<p>Métis are well-known for their ability to speak several languages. In the past, Métis people could speak up to five or six languages, including Michif, French, English, Cree, Ojibway and Bungee (or Bungi). To this day, many Métis still speak or understand multiple languages.</p>
		<p>Métis created their own dialects based on other languages. In the Prairies, these included Michif-French, Michif-Cree, Bungee and Brayet. Michif is the only Métis language that has survived today, with just under 1,200 individuals identified as speaking it according to the 2016 Canadian Census.</p>
		<p>Owing to the cultural and political resurgence of Métis, the Michif language is making a comeback. Provincial Métis organizations and the Métis Resource Centre, among others, have produced Michif dictionaries, language programs and workbooks.</p>
