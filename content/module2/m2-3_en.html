        <p>As public service employees, we need to <strong>understand and respect</strong> an individual’s decision to identify as Métis, even if they may not possess Métis rights as defined by the Supreme Court under section 35 of the <em>Constitution Act, 1982</em>.</p>
        <p>It’s not our role to define a colleague or a client as a Métis with or without Indigenous rights. Our role is to accommodate <strong>cultural perspectives</strong> and create a <strong>culturally safe environment</strong>.</p>

				<p>When you're born into a nice big brown family,<br />
				it may seem easy to identify who you are,<br />
				but when you're born with fair skin,<br />
				it can get a little confusing.</p>
				<p>I grew up in this pretty little place called the broken head reserve, and my earliest memory of any attention being brought to my race was when I was about 7.</p>
				<p>There was this teacher, who said something to me that pretty much scarred me for years to come.</p>
				<p>She said - "Indians are like apples. They may be red on the outside, but on the inside they are white, just like the rest of us and that makes them okay." And there it was.</p>
				<p>Only then it occurred to me that there were differences with people, and then I thought more of eating that apple than whatshe meant by it at the time.</p>
				<p>So, I ran out with my new knowledge and happily told at least 10 other little indians that we were all apples, and that made us all okay.</p>
				<p>This may have been true on the reserve, but when I left my community and went to a school called happy thought, us little apples got bruised.</p>
				<p>Augh!</p>
				<p>And found that we weren't so white inside. I soon noticed that I was whiter on the outside than the other kids at home, so I couldn't really be an apple. So, just what kind of a fruit am I?</p>
				<p>I earnestly tried to be okay like the rest of them. Having a pale face may have opened the doors, but that acceptance was short-lived,</p>
				<p>Even I learned how to reject my unidentifiable self. That early, but flawed label, triggered a hunger in me to find an identity that worked.</p>
				<p>As it turned out, there are plenty of people, books and governments to tell me just who I...was?</p>
				<p>Finding out I had swedish heritage (yodeling) only added to the confusion.</p>
				<p>When I was in my teens, I remember indian became a dirty word.<br />
				<strong>“F*kin’ Indian!”</strong><br />
				<strong>“Dirty Indian”</strong><br />
				<strong>“Indian giver”</strong></p>
				<p>The term indian was used in a way that put us down. Still, Indian was all I had to begin with.</p>
				<p>I am an indian.<br />
				Ah, the other kind.<br />
				I'm an indian. <br />
				that's better.<br />
				I'm a native, a native american.<br />
				I'm a half-breed.<br />
				I'm a métis.<br /> I am a red man.<br />
				I'm an ojibway.<br />
				I'm a cree.<br />
				I'm an oji-cree.<br />
				I'm an ogi-cree?<br /> I am a status indian.<br />
				I'm indigenous.<br />
				I'm a first nations person.<br />
				I'm an original inhabitant.</p>
				<p>And, of course, the latest craze, I am an aboriginal and the legendary north american indian.</p>
				<p><strong>“How!”</strong><br />
				How does one come to terms with all these terms?</p>
				<p>I lived all of them, but they still felt like the apple,and so that saga continues without me.</p>
				<p>(leaves rustling)</p>
				<p>After so many confusing years, my identity was finally revealed to me in a simple, clear way.</p>
				<p>An elder kindly said, "we are anishinabe." I am anishinabe.</p>
				<p>Translation - the human beings lowered down here from the stars. For me, this works beautifully.</p>
				<p>Oh, and as far as that fruit thing goes, apples, they say,are good for you.</p>
