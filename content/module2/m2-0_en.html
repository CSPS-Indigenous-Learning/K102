	<h2>Origins</h2>
	<p>People understand the word &ldquo;Métis&rdquo; in different ways. Originally, &ldquo;Métis&rdquo; described the children of First Nations mothers and European fathers. Over time, the meaning expanded to describe those in Canada whose language and culture derived from both European and First Nations heritages.</p>
	<p>In Quebec, &ldquo;Métis&rdquo; has been used throughout history to indicate a person of mixed heritage. Many Quebec families identified themselves as being Métis long before the Métis were recognized in the <em>Constitution Act, 1982</em>.</p>
	<p>Frequent <strong>intermarriage </strong>between First Nations and Métis community members happened which made it even more complicated. Some individuals can identify as Métis from one ancestor and as First Nations (status or non-status) from another which makes a difference in relation to rights entitlement.</p>

	<h2>Two distinct meanings today</h2>
	<p>Individuals who have both Indigenous and non-Indigenous ancestry often identify themselves as Métis. However, they may not be affiliated with an historic Métis community.</p>
	<p>Today, the term &ldquo;Métis&rdquo; is used in two different ways—which do not always align:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>It is a term individuals use to identify themselves as someone of mixed heritage</li>
		<li>It is one of the &ldquo;Aboriginal peoples of Canada&rdquo; within the meaning of section 35(2) of the <em>Constitution Act, 1982</em></li>
	</ul>
	<p>These two meanings of &ldquo;Métis&rdquo; have led to tensions between the <strong>Métis of Western Canada and those of Eastern Canada</strong>. In the West, some people believe that to be Métis, you must be able to trace your ancestry back to the Red River Resistance. This would exclude those who identify as Métis in Eastern Canada. As a result, an <strong>increasing number</strong> of Métis organizations are emerging in the East to represent Métis from Ontario and eastward.</p>
