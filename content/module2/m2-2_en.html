							<h2>Natalie</h2>
							<p><strong>Natalie</strong> was raised in Kapuskasing in Northern Ontario as a non-Indigenous person. She’s always been connected to the land and curious about culture. As a facilitator with the Indigenous Learning Series, she decided to investigate her own heritage. She discovered that:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>on her father’s side, she could retrace her roots to the first officially recorded marriage in New France (Quebec) between a French man and an Indigenous woman (Huron Nation) in the Catholic Church</li>
								<li>on her mother’s side, she was related to Jean Nicolet, a <span lang="fr"><em>coureur des bois</em></span> who married an Indigenous woman in a traditional ceremony during his stay in the Nipissing territory.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Natalie is still pursuing her genealogical inquiries. She’s on a journey of learning and reflection about privilege, identity, genetics, community and belonging.</p>
