        <p>It has now been over 100 years since Louis Riel predicted the rise of the Métis Nation.</p>
        <p>Following a long period of dispossession, injustice and impoverishment, the Métis Nation has re-emerged as a powerful, united and distinct population in Canada. It has thrived despite the racist and assimilationist government policies and practices of the past.</p>
        <!--<p><strong>Their voice is loud and their message is strong</strong></p>-->
        <p>Throughout history, Métis people have acted collectively to protect their lands and fight for their rights. They have defended their existence as a distinct Indigenous people and nation within the Canadian federation.</p>
        <p>This <strong>dedication</strong> continues today. Citizens and communities are cultivating their distinct culture, traditions, language and lifestyle while pursuing social and economic development.</p>
		<p>Many Métis families today <strong>retain their traditional approach to life</strong> and support each other through extended family ties:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Food obtained from hunting and fishing parties is shared with Elders and others</li>
            <li>Family members pass traditional knowledge on to their children</li>
            <li>Traditional herbal medicine and a holistic family-patient approach are often combined with western medicine</li>
        </ul>
